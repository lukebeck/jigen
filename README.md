[Jigen](https://lukebeck.github.io/jigen/) (字現 — as in 漢字現出分析) is a simple kanji frequency analyser. It provides a visual representation of number of uses of joyo kanji within a given text.


Jigen uses react and styled-components, and was made to help me learn these resources and fufil a fairly specific use case.
